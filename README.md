# SpaceInvaders
Space Invaders based exercise

Enemies of the same type that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a killed enemy will be killed as well. By design, these "neighbor" enemies do not give score to the player.

Enemies die if they reach the bottom of the screen, not giving any score to the player, nor killing same type neighbors.

Enemies can have different amount of HP and give different amounts of score.
